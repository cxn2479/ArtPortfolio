# ArtPortfolio

This is just a basic website to showcase some artworks created through the last few years. It includes a slideshow for art highlights, a gallery with search and sort functionality, and a simple contact form that uses web3form to handle creating and sending emails.

In the future, I plan to add more artworks as well as make the website format more user-friendly and maybe provide additional functionalities.

The website does require javascript to be enabled to properly showcase the images on the website.

Feel free to use the code for your own website formatting if you'd like.
